# First time download
The very first time you save this, in your terminal (PuTTY), copy and paste the following:

```shell
git clone https://github.com/drc14/cs1570-examples.git
```

# Every time after the very first time
After you "cloned", you don't need to clone again. Pull the examples from now on by doing the following in the cs1570-examples/ directory (make sure to be inside that directory).

```shell
git pull
```
